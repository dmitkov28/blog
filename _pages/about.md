#### About me

 I am Dimitar and I dabble in marketing and web development. I am currently based in Stuttgart, Germany and playing around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (on which this site is built on). I love science. I hate inspirational quotes over landscapes.

#### About this page 

 I have found that writing your thoughts down in a logically coherent way helps clearing inconsistencies, filling up knowledge gaps and overall improves your mental machinery. Writing your thoughts down where everyone can see them adds an additional layer of accountability, hence this site. I am probably mostly going to babble about decision theory, economics philosophy or psychology, with the occasional book review thrown in for good measure.

#### What's up with the title?
A [weak ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ontology) basically means a set of concepts that are too weakly interconnected for you to be able to draw solid conclusions from them without external help which kinda mimics most of our everyday thinking. It also sounds cool.  

But, you know, don't read too much into it.
