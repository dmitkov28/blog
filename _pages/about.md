#### About me

 I am Dimitar and I dabble in marketing and web development. I am currently based in Stuttgart, Germany. Lately, I've been goofing around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (on which this site is built on). I love science. I hate inspirational quotes on landscapes.

#### About this page 

 I have found that writing your thoughts down helps to clarify inconsistencies, fill up knowledge gaps, and it can overall improve your mental machinery. Writing your thoughts down where everyone can see them also forces some sense of accountability, and so this site was born. I am probably mostly going to babble about decision theory, economics, philosophy or psychology, with the occasional book review thrown in for good measure.

#### What's up with the title?
A [weak ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ontology) basically describes a set of concepts that are too weakly interconnected for you to be able to draw solid conclusions from them without external help, which kinda mimics most of our everyday thinking. Plus, it sounds cool.  

But, you know, don't read too much into it.
